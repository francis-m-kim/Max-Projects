# Max-Projects

A collection of projects using the visual programming language, Max/MSP. If you have Max installed on your computer, testing a patch is as simple as copying the code and selecting "New from Clipboard" in the File menu. If you don't have Max, grab a copy at [the Cycling '74 website](https://cycling74.com/downloads/). Happy patching!
